                                <b>made it.</b>
                                <br> I believed in you, I truly did.
                                <br>Now that you're here, feel free to snoop around the website. The only price you'll be paying is the price of the
                                <b> things you're not doing </b> because you decided to come here .
                                <br>
                                <br> Anyways, no need to write anything special about me here. You'll perhaps be able to come to a conclusion that I'm a programmer, or that I'm learning French in my spare time. Perhaps you might also realize that I'm in a pursuit of knowledge, and that I'm into psychology, STEM, and even economics. I threw some econ at you at the beginning of this text.
                                <br> There's some more about me, but since you're so smart - figure it out on your own. Smartass.

                            My childhood was pretty much filled with online gaming. I guess <b>addiction</b> is the right word here. I thought a lot about why that's so. I remember seeing flashy achievement messages coming up in World of Warcraft day after day, telling me how I <i>killed all those rare monsters, had all the fancy gear, owned other people in PvP engagements</i> - <u>and I was hooked</u>. I think nothing changed from the time I started playing, probably more than 10 years ago. I'm still chasing achievements.
                            <br><br> It's just that, this time, I'm aiming for different kind of achievements. And now I realize that progress can <b> and should </b> be tracked IRL, too.

                                    <i>Student dorm</i>
                                    <br> There's something about living in a student dorm that changes you as a person. It changes the way you
                                    <i>think</i>, but in a
                                    <b>much better way</b>. It shows you what life can be, once you're not bound to just your house, a few friends and 2 or 3 locations where all of you go to hangout. Being an introvert for 20 years, the dorm started pulling out the extroverted side in me, which was burried deep down.
                                    <br> And I liked it.
                                    <br> Then, I
                                    <u> I bought a tablet </u>. Now, that changed the way I spend my free time. I would download vocational e-books from the internet and read them for at least 3 or 4 hours a day. It expanded my horizon forever, and improved the way I think.
                                    <p>I went from doing OK in college to acing my programming projects - and always coming up with something new and 'original' - something that wasn't asked for, but improved the project.</p>
                                    I was also able to help out anyone (in my group) who was stuck, recognizing the bugs in their code almost instantly. I gathered experience.

                                    <br>

                                    <i>America</i>
                                    <br> Then, out of nowhere, I went to a Work&Travel agency and signed up for the program. I signed up for working in a hotel (
                                    <a href="http://www.snowking.com/" target="_blank">Snow King Resort</a>) as a housekeeper, but that quickly evolved up to me being in the front desk team. Maybe because of my language skills, maybe because of my charm. :) Jokes aside - whatever the reason was, I then had the chance to speak to hundreds - or maybe thousands? - of people (guests).
                                    <br> And. It. Was. Amazing.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br> A lot of other great things happened, but those above are the highlights. Still, I think leaving 2017 to chance is not a good idea, because I really have to accomplish something amazing to outdo the last 2 years. And that is why I think setting some goals would be a good idea.
                                    <b>However</b> they need to be very
                                    <i>specific</i>. Having unspecific goals doesn't lead anywhere.
