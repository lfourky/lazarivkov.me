                                <br> I believed in you, I truly did.
                                <br>Now that you're here, feel free to snoop around the website. The only price you'll be paying
                                is the price of the
                                <b> things you're not doing </b> because you decided to come here .
                                <br>
                                <br> Anyways, no need to write anything special about me here. You'll perhaps be able to come
                                to a conclusion that I'm a programmer, or that I'm learning French in my spare time. Perhaps
                                you might also realize that I'm in a pursuit of knowledge, and that I'm into psychology,
                                STEM, and even economics. I threw some econ at you at the beginning of this text.
                                <br> There's some more about me, but since you're so smart - figure it out on your own. Smartass.

                            My childhood was pretty much filled with online gaming. I guess
                            <b>addiction</b> is the right word here. I thought a lot about why that's so. I remember seeing
                            flashy achievement messages coming up in World of Warcraft day after day, telling me how I
                            <i>killed all those rare monsters, had all the fancy gear, owned other people in PvP engagements</i>
                            -
                            <u>and I was hooked</u>. I think nothing changed from the time I started playing, probably more
                            than 10 years ago. I'm still chasing achievements.
                            <br>
                            <br> It's just that, this time, I'm aiming for different kind of achievements. And now I realize
                            that progress can
                            <b> and should </b> be tracked IRL, too.

                       Can you easily find out whether the progress you're seeing right now is <b>not the same</b>

                      Well, for now, I think that including some kind of a "progress step list" may suffice.
                      Therefore, I'll include, along with each current progress, a list, dare I say it, of progress steps.
